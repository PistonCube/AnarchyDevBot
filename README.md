# AnarchyDevBot


A simple bot with a built-in Minecraft chat that you can chat with in real time and some commands.
this bot was created especially for my 2l2c.org server but I have decided to make it open source.


# Installation

1: Make sure you have Node.js v18.7 or higher, including npm. If you don't have it installed, you can install it at [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org), and Git (optional for cloning repositories)

2: Open the terminal or command line of your choice.

3: Run the command `git clone https://github.com/juancitocubo/AnarchyDevBot` 
Or, click on the green "Code" button that has the download icon and click on "Download ZIP".

4: After the repository is cloned or downloaded to your disk, run `cd AnarchyDevBot`

5: You'll need to install dependencies first, run `npm i or npm install`

6: after you have everything downloaded and installed you have to configure everything from (./config.json)

7: After it is installed, run `npm start or node index.js`

and now to enjoy the bot, please if you are going to use the bot do not pass it off as you created it, it took a long time to create it and I would appreciate it if you did not do that

Remember that this bot is not 100% finished, so it will be modified every so often. Remember that if you want to contribute something to this Bot, you can send it to my discord:
